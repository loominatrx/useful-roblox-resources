I've been browsing the DevForum lately as there are many awesome resources that I can use for my personal projects. I had a thought to share them here so you don't have to search those awesome resources by yourself (considering most of the DevForum post on Resources category is filled with badly coded resources nowadays, no offense though), and here it is. Make sure to credit the creator of the library that you're using somewhere on your game (even if the creator didn't ask to) as a appreciation for making such amazing resources!

This list contains **safe resources** that you can use for your games, so you don't have to worry about them being a malicious resource.

<sup>Also, this repo will be updated as long as I found something interesting on DevForum (or GitHub) and will not be updated frequently.

_I expect you to have some knowledge about scripting and/or Roblox Studio in general, because some of these tutorials can be complicated. I can't really help you if you have some issues with them because I don't make those tutorials._

- [How to use ProfileService + ReplicaService](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/1464984)
  > I encourage you to read this one. It's really useful if you are developing big project that has inventory system or such.
- [Saving player data to MongoDB Atlas in the cloud.](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/632977)
  > If you don't want to use DataStore as your saving method, you can read this tutorial. Since it's saved to MongoDB, you can use those data for other purposes too! For example: making a Discord bot dedicated for your game. Do note that if you have a game with large playerbase, the costs of your MongoDB database might increase.

### Foot notes

[^1]: According to [this DevForum post](https://devforum.roblox.com/t//846799), session locking is a solution to dealing with the race condition between loading and saving data with DataStore API calls, when for instance, loading data is faster than the data being saved in a time frame despite saving data being first.
[^2]: Explained by the man himself (loleris): Assume that a [state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science)) is any kind of data that has a present version and may also change at any time in the future, as many times as necessary. The data about a player which you load up during gameplay or save to the DataStore is a state. The color of a part, text shown on a users screen and furniture placed in a player owned house are all states - ReplicaService helps you make server-side code to control and replicate any state to all clients at once or only a select few.
